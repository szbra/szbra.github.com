# Markdown Examples

This repository contains example plugins that add tooling support for working with [Markdown][] files in [Orion][]
The examples are structured as a series of five exercises as follows:

1. Simple hello world plugin
2. Extending the Orion navigator
3. Simple Orion editor extensions (editor command, syntax highlighting, content assist)
4. Advanced Orion editor extensions (outliner, syntax validation
5. A custom Orion page with a markdown viewer

You can either attempt to do the exercises alone, or refer to the "solutions" folder which has completed versions of each example.

There is also an "extras" folder with a few additional bonus examples, and a single combined markdown plugin that has the functionality
from all the previous exercises.
